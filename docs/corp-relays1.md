We are writing to you as one of the many entities that utilizes open source BSD 
Unix in your operations.

We formally launched the Tor BSD Diversity Project (TDP) in March 2015 to enhance the use of the BSDs in the public anonymity Tor network. Since then, TDP managed a long list of accomplishments including porting Tor Browser to OpenBSD and significantly increasing BSD usage overall. We presented or conducted birds-of-feather sessions at BSD conferences from New York City and Ottawa to Fortaleza in Brazil.

One critical element in our approach is enlisting BSD-using firms in contributing.

With internet privacy a critical tool for journalists, human rights workers and so many other others around the globe, we envision a host of new Tor network nodes running your preferred BSD as a public relay.

BSD firms are known for their critical role in infrastructure and development. With that role comes significant resources with skilled staffs, robust operations and a commitment to a better internet.

Running a BSD-based Tor relay is an excellent way to put those resources to that commitment to a better internet.

Most Tor relay operators are volunteers, offering meager resourcs of inexpensive virtual private servers or single colocated servers. A decent relay contributed by your firm could assist in strengthening the Tor network greatly.

In late 2015, Mozilla made a [commitment to operate 12 Tor relays](https://blog.mozilla.org/it/2015/01/28/deploying-tor-relays/). This contribution greatly increased the available bandwidth on the Tor network.

Outside of the previously stated points, what are the benefits for your firm running a public Tor relay on a BSD?
