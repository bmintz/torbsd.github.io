###Preliminary Questions###

####Why should My BSD-using entity run a BSD relay?####

There are multiple reasons on multiple levels to why your entity should run a relay.

* a Tor node with the Nickname of your software project or company conveys your committment to unrestricted internet access

####Is there a benefit to the Tor network if my entity runs a node?####

Tor itself benefts on a number of levels.

* for an entity running a BSD, Tor benefits from the diversification on the operating system level, as the Tor ecosystem is overwhelmingly Linux

####Do other entities or projects run their own Tor nodes?####

The most notable example, and a great example for others, is Mozilla running 12 Tor relays starting in December 2014.

Mozilla's relays were a significant contribution to the Tor network, and their nodes also allow exit traffic.

At this point, New York Internet has contributed two high-bandwidth Tor relays out of its New Jersey data center to the __TDP__ effort.

####What resources do we need to run a BSD relay?####

The main requirements are usually accessible to any entity running a minimal infrastructure:

* at least one public IP address, separate from your production IP block

* a dedicated computer capable of routing internet data, from an APU to a multi-core server with gigabytes of RAM

* a method of upgrading and maintaining the system, in whatever manner is the norm for your entity, whether manual, shell scripts or configuration management tools

####What is the time/labor committment?####

Most entities should only require a few hours to build, configure and test a Tor relay, assuming a purely manual purpose.

Binary and/or automated upgrades are easy enough with the BSDs, and for a single-purpose system such as a Tor relay, the task is even simpler.

####Will there be any problems with my IP space, including blacklisting, etc?####

While not an impossible task, __TDP__ recommends just running a non-exit Tor node, i.e., one which is not the final hop in the Tor three-hop circuit, and therefore is not the IP the TCP destination sees.

Of course, running an exit node would be a terrific contribution, but initally we recommend taking this one step at a time.

Tor relay IPs are all public, not just the exit nodes, and if you don't have an IP in a separate block, it might make more sense to run a bridge. Tor bridges are private gateways into the Tor network selectively distributed to censored users.
